A [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook for [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

Distributed as a standalone repository to enable installing Ruff via prebuilt wheels from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/).

### Using Ruff with pre-commit

To run Ruff's [linter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/linter) and [formatter](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter)
(available as of Ruff v0.0.289) via pre-commit, add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.3.4
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

To enable lint fixes, add the `--fix` argument to the lint hook:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.3.4
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
```

To run the hooks over Jupyter Notebooks too, add `jupyter` to the list of allowed filetypes:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
  # Ruff version.
  rev: v0.3.4
  hooks:
    # Run the linter.
    - id: ruff
      types_or: [ python, pyi, jupyter ]
      args: [ --fix ]
    # Run the formatter.
    - id: ruff-format
      types_or: [ python, pyi, jupyter ]
```

When running with `--fix`, Ruff's lint hook should be placed _before_ Ruff's formatter hook, and
_before_ Black, isort, and other formatting tools, as Ruff's fix behavior can output code changes
that require reformatting.

When running without `--fix`, Ruff's formatter hook can be placed before or after Ruff's lint hook.

(As long as your Ruff configuration avoids any [linter-formatter incompatibilities](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/#conflicting-lint-rules),
`ruff format` should never introduce new lint errors, so it's safe to run Ruff's format hook _after_
`ruff check --fix`.)
